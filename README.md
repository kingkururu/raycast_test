## Features

- **Raycasting Engine**: Renders 3D-looking environments from 2D tile maps
- **Player Movement**: W and S keys for forward/backward
- **Camera Rotation**: A and D keys for left/right view rotation
- **Distance-Based Rendering**: Walls appear taller when closer, shorter when farther
- **Fisheye Correction**: Geometric accuracy using trigonometric functions
- **Collision Detection**: Player restricted to walkable black tiles
- **Mini-Map Visualization**: Real-time representation of player position and rays
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient ray casting with boundary collision

## Technical Implementation

### Core Raycasting Algorithm
The raycasting system casts rays at regular intervals across the player's field of view to calculate distances to wall surfaces. Each ray's intersection with walls determines the height of vertical slices rendered on screen, creating a 3D perspective effect.

### Key Components
- **Ray Casting**: Measures distances to walls using trigonometric calculations
- **Vertical Slice Rendering**: Draws walls as rectangles with heights based on distance
- **Fisheye Correction**: Corrects distortion using cosine of angle between ray and viewing direction
- **Collision System**: Integrated with tile-based map for movement restrictions
- **Map Visualization**: Mini-map window showing real-time ray intersections

### Graphics Rendering
- **Distance-Based Shading**: Walls become darker with distance for depth illusion
- **Geometric Accuracy**: Trigonometric functions ensure proper perspective
- **Boundary Detection**: Rays stop at wall intersections for accurate measurements
- **View Frustum**: Field of view calculations for realistic 3D projection
  
## Controls

- **W**: Move forward
- **S**: Move backward  
- **A**: Rotate camera left / turn player left
- **D**: Rotate camera right / turn player right

### Prerequisites
- **Compiler**: Requires clang++ (or g++) with C++17 support
- **SFML**: Simple and Fast Multimedia Library for graphics and windowing
- **Custom Game Framework**: Built on top of the SFML Game Framework

## Building & Running

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kingkururu/raycast_test
   cd raycast_test (location will be different)
   ```

2. **Build the Project**:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
   This will compile the raycasting demo along with the game framework.

3. **Run the Demo**:
   ```bash
   make run
   ```

4. **Clean the Build**:
   ```bash
   make clean
   ```
### Alternative Setup (macOS with Homebrew)

1. **Install SFML**:
   ```bash
   # Install Homebrew if not already installed
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   
   # Install SFML
   brew install sfml@2
   brew install .... (other missing libraries)
   ```

2. **Configure PATH** (add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile):
   ```bash
   export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"
   export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/sfml@2/bin:$PATH"
   export PATH="path to other libraries if any of them is missing)
   ```
